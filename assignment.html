<h1><b> My assignment.html page for linking to assignment items described in Assignment and Report Specifications</b></h1>
<p><br></p>
<p>This page is the marking guide to your website that your tutor will 
use to find your elements.  Do not name this page anything other than 
assignment.html (all lower case) or else we may not be able to find and 
mark your assignment elements.<span>&nbsp; </span>How to use this page:</p>
<ul>
  <li>upload this assignment.html file in your website directory during part 2.2.2 of Lab 1</li>
  <li>later, link this page to your website's index.html page</li>
  <li>over time, link each assignment task listed below to its location in your website as soon as you have started it</li>
  <li>replace the "notes" paragraph with your notes or 
delete if you have no notes - your notes will help us understand and 
mark your site so you should explain things. Maybe you did a task 
differently from the way we specified it, either because your way is 
better (tell us) or minimally or not at all to fit in with your site's 
look and feel (tell us) or ... (also tell us). So, for example, a video 
might spoil the look and feel. What you do is make one anyway, link to 
it from this assessment.html page and explain in the <i>Notes</i> why 
it's not linked to from your public version of your web site. You can 
style this page as your like, so long as you keep the links to the 
assignment tasks.</li>
  <li>provide details for your best student forums posts where indicated</li>
  <li>provide the date you attended the continuous improvement session where indicated</li>
  <li>provide link to report where indicated</li>
  <li>delete these instructions when you are ready</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="contact.html"> MyPassion.com Contact Page </a></p>
<p>The MyPassion.com as a whole includes the "Home", "About my site", "Photo Gallery", "Story Video", "Feedback", "Contact me" these six parts.
For providing better visitor experience, I designed a feedback form which is important to improve the website display content. Meanwhile, a detailed contact page is also necessary to interact with visitor to build long term relationship.
"About my site" is still in construction, however it is vital to explain the objectives of building this website and show the visitor how to explore the website to gain more interesting experience.</p>
